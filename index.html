      <div class="card-blurb" id="cardBlurb1">In the past, there was no technology that facilitated interpersonal relationships. To interact with someone else, you would have to be physically with them.</div>

      <div class="card-blurb" id="cardBlurb2">With the advent of mail, people were now able to communicate over long distance. It was now possible to continue a relationship with someone over a long distance, a 'long distance relationship'.</div>

      <div class="card-blurb" id="cardBlurb3">Currently, technology allows many ways to communicate over long distance. These include sending texts, phone calls, face time, and many other ways to communicate.</div>

      <img class="card-image" id="cardImage4" src="./images/Picture4.png"></img>
      <div class="card-blurb" id="cardBlurb4">Today, it is possible to form new relationships through technology. This could be through shared interests, like a community forum where users talk to each other, or through shared activities, like online video games.</div>

      <img class="card-image" id="cardImage5" src="./images/Picture5.png"></img>
      <div class="card-blurb" id="cardBlurb5">Future technology will allow long distance relationships to be even more intimate. A technology that is being developed currently is the friend scope, which allows people to share their vision.

      <div class="card-blurb" id="cardBlurb6">Imagination is the limit when considering how interpersonal relationships might look in the future. Sharing thoughts directly, lifelike 3d holograms, shared senses of taste, touch and smell; none of these things are impossible.</div>
